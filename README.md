# I Can Haz a File?
This is a utility I started a long time ago to index files, especially
backups, and identify duplicates. I may or may not ever complete it, but in
the meantime I figured I should at least archive it on GitHub (migrating
from Mercurial in the process).

## ToDo

- Create a `requirements.txt` for whatever dependencies it needs. I know it
  uses some ancient version SQLAlchemy.
- Take stock of the functionality and create a roadmap or just punt it.
  By now, there might/should be plenty of tools that do what I had in mind 
  for this back when I started it.
